Project Name â€“ Cab Fare Prediction
You are a cab rental start-up company. You have successfully run the pilot project and
now want to launch your cab service across the country. You have collected the
historical data from your pilot project and now have a requirement to apply analytics for
fare prediction. You need to design a system that predicts the fare amount for a cab ride
in the city.
Build the model using train data in file train_cab.csv to predict test data in file test.csv
The main aim of this project is to build a high performance model better than the existing one.
Challenge for every data scientist.
